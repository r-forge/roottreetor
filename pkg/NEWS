RootTreeToR v4.1 June 2009
o Fixed non-const char* problem by using std::string instead.
o Removed unneeded extern "C" around R includes
o In R v2.9 SET_ELEMENT for a character vector no longer works. Replace with
	SET_STRING_ELT. 
o Commented out call to GetEntry(0) from RootChainManger::names. This is apparently
	not needed and was causing unresolved symbol problems for D0 TMBTree's.  
o For toR and toRUser, if nEntries is <= 0, make it 99,999,999 . 
o GetHists and related functions can now deal with TH1D histograms as well as TH1F. 

Old tags...
4.0 Full documentation. Released version.

v3_3 Added ability to read Root histogram files. No documentation yet.

v3_2 Added writeDFToRoot to write a data frame to a simple Root tree. Also
added tests for WriteDFToRoot. Added tracing to treeToR

v3_1 Now uses Makevars and a configure.ac file instead of a Makefile. 
Also switched to NAMESPACE usage.

v3_0 TreeToR now inherits from TSelector. 

v2_1 -- Fixed PROTECT problems in RDataFrame. Completely rewrote the memory 
management for the R data. Now, each column object keeps its own R vector
of information. When the user asks for the data frame, then and only then
does that actual data frame get made.

v2_0 -- First version that wraps the R data frame in the RDataFrame class

v1_3 -- Version of code that does *not* wrap the R Data Frame
